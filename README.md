# üåç Project Overview
The increasing global demand for food places immense pressure on natural resources, contributing significantly to environmental degradation. According to [Our world in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food), food production accounts for 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions, occupies half of the world‚Äôs habitable land, and is responsible for 70% of freshwater withdrawals. Additionally, agricultural activities contribute to 78% of global ocean and freshwater eutrophication, leading to severe nutrient pollution in waterways.

Without intervention, these environmental impacts will continue to accelerate climate change, deplete water resources, and threaten biodiversity. Understanding the environmental footprint of different food products is crucial for designing sustainable food systems. This project aims to quantify and analyze these impacts, identifying high-impact areas and potential pathways for sustainability.

By leveraging data-driven insights, we will explore:

- The extent of greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and land use associated with different food types.

- The comparative impact of plant-based vs. animal-based products.

- The contribution of different foods to water pollution through eutrophication.

- Actionable strategies to promote sustainable food choices at both consumer and policy levels.
